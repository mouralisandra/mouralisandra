### Hi there 👋
✨ Hi there, I'm Sandra Mourali! ✨

👩‍🎓 I'm a 21-year-old third-year software engineering student at INSAT, and I'm incredibly passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

💻 I love working on full-stack web development projects as a hobby because it combines the worlds of logic and creativity.

🤖 When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me tinkering with my latest ML or DL project, watching tech documentaries, or reading up on the latest advancements in artificial intelligence.

🌟 I'm always eager to learn and grow as a developer, and I'm constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.

🚀 So if you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic team member who's always up for a coding challenge, feel free to reach out and connect with me!

👩‍💻 Let's build something awesome together!
