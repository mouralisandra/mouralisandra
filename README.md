### ✨ Welcome to my cozy little corner of GitHub! ✨

🌸 I'm Sandra Mourali, a 21-year-old software engineering student in my 3rd year at INSAT. 🌸

🍃🐝 My passions lie in the world of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 🐝🍃

🍄 When I'm not busy with schoolwork, you can find me tinkering away at various web development projects, as I love the combination of logical thinking and creativity that it offers. 🍄

🌼 On GitHub, you'll find a mix of my personal and academic projects including some of my favorite machine learning and web development projects. 🌼

🌻 I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge, so feel free to reach out and connect with me! 🌻
